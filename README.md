This is the PIC32MZ based open source 8-ch USB-trasport project.
It developed and tested to work with native windows UAC2.0 driver, but also works in linux and macos OS's.


To use project in custom design:
1. Set global settings in the system.h header.
2. Set pinout in the ports driver: ports.c & ports.h.
3. Correct custom application functions in app.c
